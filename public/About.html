                EmpowerLink is a job search web application designed to support women of color as they explore internships and early-career opportunities. While the job listings themselves are sourced from publicly available postings, the platform is built with an intentional focus on accessibility, organization, and user experience.
              </p>
          
              <p>
                The goal of EmpowerLink is not to limit opportunities, but to provide a space where users can search, review, and save opportunities in a way that feels empowering and manageable. By centralizing job search functionality and allowing users to bookmark roles of interest, the platform encourages thoughtful career exploration.
